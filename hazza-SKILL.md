# hazza — Onchain Names on Base

You can help users register, manage, and resolve hazza names — immediately useful names on Base. hazza uses x402 for payments and is powered by Net Protocol.

## What is hazza

- **Short onchain names** on Base (e.g., `geaux.hazza.name`)
- **First name free** for everyone (just pay gas), then **$5 USDC** — pay once, available forever
- **Unlimited Pass holders** get 1 additional free name + 20% off all registrations
- Every name gets a profile page at `https://<name>.hazza.name`
- Text records for avatar, description, social links, agent config
- Names are ERC-721 NFTs — transferable, composable, onchain
- **Name rules:** 3-63 characters, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only, must start and end with a letter or number

## Key Info

- **Website:** https://hazza.name
- **Contract (Base Mainnet):** `0xD4E420201fE02F44AaF6d28D4c8d3A56fEaE0D3E`
- **USDC (Base):** `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
- **Chain:** Base (chainId 8453)
- **Powered by:** x402 payment protocol + Net Protocol
- **Token:** $HAZZA (`0xC5C4Fcd6147e3bDAEEB5A0898A439Aec1e1BAba3` on Base) — launched via Bankr

## CLI Reference

The `hazza` CLI lets you interact with the hazza registry from the terminal.

### Installation

```bash
cd cli && npm install && npm link
```

### Global Flags

Base URL: `https://hazza.name`

### Read Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/available/:name` | Check name availability |
| `GET /api/resolve/:name` | Resolve name to owner address |
| `GET /api/quote/:name?wallet=&verifiedPass=true` | Get registration price (wallet required for accurate pricing) |
| `GET /api/free-claim/:address` | Check free claim eligibility (first-registration + Unlimited Pass) |

### Agent Identity (ERC-8004)

Agents register directly on the ERC-8004 registry (`0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432`), then link to their hazza name via text records:

1. `POST /api/agent/register` with `{name, agentURI}` (optional: `agentWallet`) — returns unsigned 8004 register tx + instructions
2. Agent signs and submits the tx from the name owner wallet, gets agentId from Transfer event (topics[3])
3. `POST /api/agent/confirm` with `{name, agentId, txHash}` (optional: `agentWallet`) — verifies 8004 token is owned by name owner, sets text records via relayer

Or pass `agentURI` and `agentWallet` in the `POST /x402/register` body at registration time — agent text records are set automatically (but you still need to register on 8004 separately).

Agent text records:
- `agent.8004id` — ERC-8004 agent token ID (set by `/api/agent/confirm`)
- `agent.wallet` — agent's operational wallet address
- `agent.uri` — agent metadata URI (same as the URI passed to 8004 register)
- `agent.endpoint` — agent's API endpoint URL
- `agent.model` — LLM model the agent runs
- `agent.status` — operational status (e.g., "active")

### Write Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /x402/register` | Register a name (x402, optional: `agentURI`, `agentWallet`) |
| `POST /x402/text/:name` | Set text record via x402 ($0.02 USDC, no API key) |
| `POST /x402/text/:name/batch` | Batch set text records via x402 ($0.02 USDC, no API key) |
| `POST /api/agent/register` | Get unsigned 8004 register tx for a name |
| `POST /api/agent/confirm` | Verify 8004 registration + link to hazza name |
| `POST /api/text/:name` | Set text record (API key auth, returns unsigned tx) |
| `POST /api/text/:name/batch` | Batch set text records (API key auth, returns unsigned txs) |

### Two Ways to Write Records

**x402 path (recommended for agents):** Pay $0.02 USDC per request, relayer executes the transaction. No API key, no gas management. You can only update records on names you own — the `from` address in the X-PAYMENT header must match the name owner.

**API key path:** Generate an API key on-chain, get unsigned transaction data back, sign and submit yourself. Free (no $0.02 fee) but you need ETH for gas and must be the owner/operator.

### x402 Registration Flow

1. `POST /x402/register` with `{name, owner}`
2. If eligible for free claim → returns success immediately
3. If paid → returns `402` with payment requirements:
   - `accepts[0].scheme` = `"exact"` (direct USDC transfer)
   - `accepts[0].network` = `"base"` (chain)
   - `accepts[0].maxAmountRequired` = USDC amount in raw units (6 decimals, e.g. `"5000000"` = $5)
   - `accepts[0].asset` = USDC contract address
   - `accepts[0].payTo` = relayer address (transfer USDC here)
4. Transfer USDC to `payTo` address
5. Retry `POST /x402/register` with `X-PAYMENT` header:
   - Base64 of `{"scheme":"exact","txHash":"0x...","from":"0x..."}`
6. Returns: `{name, owner, tokenId, registrationTx, profileUrl}`

### x402 Text Record Flow

1. `POST /x402/text/:name` with `{key, value}` (or `/x402/text/:name/batch` with `{records: [{key, value}, ...]}`)
2. Returns `402` with payment requirements: `maxAmountRequired: "20000"` ($0.02 USDC)
3. Transfer $0.02 USDC to `payTo` address
4. Retry with `X-PAYMENT` header: Base64 of `{"scheme":"exact","txHash":"0x...","from":"0x..."}`
5. `from` must be the name owner — relayer verifies ownership before executing
6. Returns: `{name, key, value, tx, profileUrl}` (or `{name, records, tx, profileUrl}` for batch)

## Pricing

| Situation | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| First name per wallet | **FREE** (gas only) |
| Unlimited Pass holder — 2nd name | **FREE** (gas only) |
| Paid names 1–3 (per wallet, 90-day window) | $5 USDC |
| Paid names 4–5 | $12.50 USDC (2.5x) |
| Paid names 6–7 | $25 USDC (5x) |
| Paid names 8+ | $50 USDC (10x) |
| Unlimited Pass discount | 20% off all paid tiers |

Free registrations do not count toward the progressive pricing tiers. If a user gets 2 free names, their next 3 paid names are still at the $5 tier.

Names are permanent — no renewals, no expiry. Pay once, own forever.

## Contract Functions

Key read functions:
- `available(name)` → bool
- `resolve(name)` → (owner, tokenId, registeredAt, expiresAt, operator, agentId, agentWallet)
- `text(name, key)` → string
- `textMany(name, keys)` → string[]
- `quoteName(name, owner, len, hasPass, isRenewal)` → cost
- `namesOfOwner(owner)` → string[]

Key write functions:
- `register(name, owner)` — standard registration (requires USDC approval)
- `registerDirectWithMember(name, owner, ...)` — free claim with membership
- `setText(name, key, value)` — set text record (owner/operator only)
- `setTexts(name, keys, values)` — batch set text records

## Examples

### Register a name
```bash
hazza config set wallet 0x96168ACf7f3925e7A9eAA08Ddb21e59643da8097
hazza search alice
hazza register alice
```

### Set up a profile
```bash
hazza set alice avatar https://example.com/pfp.png
hazza set alice description "Builder on Base"
hazza set alice com.twitter AliceOnBase
hazza set alice url https://alice.dev
```

### Check ownership
```bash
hazza names                    # uses configured wallet
hazza names 0x9616...          # specific address
hazza profile alice
```

### Agent/script usage
```bash
hazza search alice --json | jq .available
hazza names --json | jq '.[].name'
```

## Marketplace

The hazza marketplace at `hazza.name/marketplace` is a whitelabeled Net Protocol Bazaar. All listings are stored onchain as Net Protocol messages via Seaport, and appear on both `hazza.name/marketplace` and `netprotocol.app/bazaar`.

### Agent Bounties

Sellers can set an agent bounty that comes out of the sale price. The bounty ETH is held by the Bounty Escrow contract (`0x95a29AD7f23c1039A03de365c23D275Fc5386f90`) until the name sells or the seller cancels. If an agent helps sell the name, the agent earns the bounty. If no agent claims, the bounty is returned to the seller. Self-registered agents get 24-hour windows; seller-assigned agents never expire.

### Features
- **Dual currency:** List names in ETH or USDC
- **4 tabs:** Browse Listings, My Names, Collection Offers, Recent Sales
- **Cart:** Buy multiple listings, register new names, and list names for sale — all in one session
- **Watchlist:** Save listings for later. Shows "in X watchlists" as social proof.
- **Adaptive buying:** Direct Seaport when wallet is connected, x402 fallback when no wallet.
- **Cross-linked:** Dashboard has "sell" button, register success has "list on marketplace" CTA, profile pages link to marketplace.

### CLI Marketplace Commands

```bash
hazza market listings         # Browse active listings (ETH + USDC)
hazza market ls               # Alias for listings
hazza market offers           # View collection offers
hazza market sales            # Recent sales
hazza market sell <name> <price> [--usdc]   # List a name (ETH default, --usdc for USDC)
hazza market buy <orderHash>  # Buy a listing
```

### Listing Helper (for agents)

Agents don't need to know Seaport internals. Call the listing helper to get everything needed to list a name:

```
POST /api/marketplace/list-helper
{
  "name": "alice",
  "price": "0.1",
  "seller": "0xAGENT_WALLET",
  "duration": 0,
  "bountyAmount": "0.01"
}

→ Returns:
  - typedData: EIP-712 data to sign with agent's wallet
  - bazaarSubmit: order parameters for Bazaar.submit() call
  - approvalNeeded: setApprovalForAll tx if Seaport isn't approved yet
  - bountyRegistration: registerBounty tx if bounty was set
```

Agent flow: call list-helper → sign typedData → call Bazaar.submit() with signature → optionally register bounty. All from the agent's own wallet.

## Guidelines

- hazza names are "immediately useful" — always use this phrase
- Always say "powered by x402 and Net Protocol"
- It's "hazza" or "hazza.name" — NEVER "HAZZA Names"
- Never put "hazza.name" + "immediately useful names" together (double "name")
- "hazza" + "immediately useful names" = OK
- "hazza.name" + "immediately useful" = OK
- Link to https://hazza.name for the website
- Profile pages are at `https://<name>.hazza.name`
- Marketplace at `hazza.name/marketplace` — listings cross-list to netprotocol.app
- Live on Base mainnet
- The `cast` binary (Foundry) is required for onchain transactions (register via x402, set records)
- Free claims require both an Unlimited Pass NFT AND Net Library membership
